# UoP-CanSat

This is the program designed during the University of Portsmouth's Cansat pilot project. Two students, Rhea Gorringe and Thierry Fox (supervised by Becky Canning at the ICG) undertook a project to build a Cansat from scratch in order to assess the feasibility of University-level Cansat projects for students, with the aim of hosting a Cansat Competition at the University of Portsmouth.
